## Writing

### Introduction

- [ ] Do I explain, in less than 2 pages, what my RQ is, what I find, and how I found it?
- [ ] Do I _kindly_ explain the gap that I am filling in the scholarship? (Not “no one has studied this” as the main reason)
- [ ] If empirical: Do I clearly explain the coolness of my data or method?
- [ ] Do I have at least one sentence that explains why anyone cares about my finding?
- [ ] Do I provide a roadmap of what's to come in the manuscript? (first, we... second, we...)
- [ ] Do I clearly state the purpose of the paper? (like, actually write, "The purpose of this study is....")
- [ ] Does the introduction pack a punch - aka, would I even want to read my own article?
			

### Theoretical Framework

- [ ] Have I selected an appropriate theoretical framework for my research?
- [ ] Have I identified how the theory connects to my context/problem?
- [ ] Do I use a logical flow (conceptual map - see [Grant and Osanloo, 2014)](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1058505)?

## Tables & Figures

- [ ] Does the text clearly explain how to interpret each table or figure?
