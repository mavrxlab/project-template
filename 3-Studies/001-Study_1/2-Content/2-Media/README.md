# Media folder structure

Here is where you should keep media files for each individual case/instance/participant/etc. It's entirely possible you will not use this folder at all.

**Remember: if you're keeping this project folder structure online like via GitHub, do NOT upload photos, images, recordings, or other materials that identify participants as per your ethical governance documents (IRB).**

Simply copy `001` as many times as necessary and rename as appropriate. This is really just to get you started.

## Structure

The RAW folder should be obvious: simply place your files into the folders corresponding with the device they came from. If you're using different devices from what are typically used in the lab (comprehensive list in the template), replace and remove as necessary.

The LIVEWORKS folder may be unfamiliar and likely mostly go unused beyond the `Project`, `PROXIES`, and `EXPORTS` folders.
