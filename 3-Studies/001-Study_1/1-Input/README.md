Remember, this folder is not for raw data, data loading, or munging scripts. Those go in the `3-Data_Analysis` folder. Instead, this folder is for the files and documents used in the study, itself, like the survey instrument, videos or images shown to participants, and so on. This includes recruitment content, graphics, et cetera. Also include any codename generation scripts.
