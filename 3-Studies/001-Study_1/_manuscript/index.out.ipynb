    "You can add acronyms using the `acronyms` extension and shortcodes. For example, {{\\< acr qmd \>}} gives you Quarto document (qmd). Then, when you use {{\\< acr qmd \>}} subsequent times, it would simply show the acronym, like so: qmd. Very convenient. When talking about qmd frontmatter, you might say:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Parenthetical References\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some variations on parenthetical citations:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Page references (or any other suffixes are placed after the reference. If you want a comma, you’ll need to insert it yourself: ([Cameron and Trivedi 2013, 35–41](#ref-CameronTrivedi2013))\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Prefixes (with or without a comma) are placed before the reference: (e.g., [Cameron and Trivedi 2013](#ref-CameronTrivedi2013)).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   2 or more citations separated by a semicolon ([Cameron and Trivedi 2013](#ref-CameronTrivedi2013); [Cohen et al. 2003](#ref-cohen2003applied)). If you need a prefix at the beginning of 2 or more citations, you will have rearrange the citations so that the prefix accompanies the citation that is first alphabetically. That is, (e.g., [Cameron and Trivedi 2013](#ref-CameronTrivedi2013); [Cohen et al. 2003](#ref-cohen2003applied)), not (e.g., [Cohen et al. 2003](#ref-cohen2003applied); [Cameron and Trivedi 2013](#ref-CameronTrivedi2013))\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Any prefixes or suffixes needing a literal semicolon will confuse Quarto (actually Pandoc). To make it clear that you need to print a semicolon, put a backslash before the semicolon: (FOIL; [Cameron and Trivedi 2013](#ref-CameronTrivedi2013)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### In-Text references\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Cameron and Trivedi ([2013](#ref-CameronTrivedi2013)) said some interesting things.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Cohen et al. ([2003, 101–3](#ref-cohen2003applied)) said specific things on specific pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Place the reference’s year by itself with a minus sign: ([2013](#ref-CameronTrivedi2013))\n",
    "\n",
    "### Masked references\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you want to cite a previous reference of yours, but your anonymity is supposed to be protected in the review process. You can “mask” any citation you wish by setting the `mask` field in the metadata yaml to `true`. Then list all citations that need to be masked in the `masked-citations` field as shown in this template. If the `mask` field is set to `false`, they will print as ususual. Depending if it is an inline or parenthetical citation, will be listed as “Masked Citations (n.d)” or “(Masked Citations, n.d)”.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have set two of my publications to be masked. In previous studies, things were asserted ([Schneider and Newman 2015](#ref-schneider2015intelligence)). Schneider and McGrew ([2012](#ref-schneider2012cattell)) asserted them emphatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can mix masked and unmasked citations ([Cohen et al. 2003](#ref-cohen2003applied); [Schneider and Newman 2015](#ref-schneider2015intelligence)).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Block Quotes and Suppressing Indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you want to give a longer quote that needs to go in its own paragraph. Block quotes are on their own line starting with the `>` character. For example, Jane Austen’s ([\\[1814\\] 1990](#ref-austenMansfieldPark1990)) *Mansfield Park* has some memorable insights about the mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "> If any one faculty of our nature may be called more wonderful than the rest, I do think it is memory. There seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers, the failures, the inequalities of memory, than in any other of our intelligences. The memory is sometimes so retentive, so serviceable, so obedient; at others, so bewildered and so weak; and at others again, so tyrannic, so beyond control! We are, to be sure, a miracle every way; but our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly past finding out. (p. 163)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the text after a quote is a new paragraph, you can create it in the usual fashion (i.e., plain text with an empty line between the block text and the new paragraph). However, if the text after a quote is part of the same paragraph, you can suppress the indentation by creating a div with the .NoIndent class. This paragraph is an example of how to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypotheses, Aims, and Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The last paragraph of the introduction usually states the specific hypotheses of the study, often in a way that links them to the research design.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Method\n",
    "\n",
    "General remarks on method. This paragraph is optional.\n",
    "\n",
