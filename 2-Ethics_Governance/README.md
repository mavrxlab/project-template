# Ethics Governance

## Ethics Approval

Use this folder for Institutional Research Board (IRB) documents, drafting, notes, and attachments.

## Consent Forms

Again, this folder is for **blank** consent forms, waivers, compensation forms, and so on. While these are often included in the Ethics Approval submissions, keep copies for printing and/or sending here for ease.
