## Project Overview

This is a large repository meant to house any number of individual studies and drafts that are all in some way connected. For example, in the `1-Project_Management/2-Finance/` folder, there is a sub-project for developing an NSF grant. As a variety of studies will often come of a single grant, these are held in the `3-Studies` folder.

Note that you're welcome to use a copy of this repository for _each_ individual study if you like. It is meant to be flexible. Not everything need even be used. No grant? Skip the Finance folder, for example.
